The source code in pipe.f controls the use of named pipes to compare two
identical runs, the "master" vs the "slave".  These typically differ only
in the number of processors used, i.e. in the values of NOMP and NMPI.  
Often the master is on a single processor, i.e. NMPI=0 and NOMP=0 or 1.
The comparison is made for every element of every array sent over the 
named pipe from the slave to the master.  By default, most of the significant
model arrays are compared after each major phase of each time step.  If
an error (i.e. a difference between master and slave runs) is detected,
additional calls to comparall or compare can be added in the subroutine
that introduced the error to find out exactly which OpenMP loop needs
modifying.  Named pipes can be difficult to use from Fortran.  The
current open statement has worked on all machines tried so far, but
it might require modification on a new machine.

The first task of each run must be on the same node (i.e. the same O/S
image), for the named pipe to work.  This will almost always be the
case when comparing two OpenMP runs, but can be harder to arrange for
MPI runs.  The easiest MPI-based named pipe comparisons to make are 
with a single processor master without MPI, but because this involves 
two different executables make sure they were created with identical 
compiler options (typically TYPE=mpi with TYPE=one and TYPE=ompi with 
TYPE=omp).

The script 016y001T_pipe.com illustrates how to configure an OpenMP test 
run.  It creates a named pipe and two separate data directories, dataT01 
and dataT03.  The named pipe is linked to PIPE_MASTER in dataT01 and to
PIPE_SLAVE in dataT03.  The existence of these filenames switches on
the named pipe comparison.  Finally the two "twin"runs scripts,
016y001T01.com and 016y001T03.com, are run in the background and the job
waits for both to end.  If no errors are detected, 016y001T_pipe.com will
end normally.  However, if the two runs do not produce exactly identical
results the "master" will terminate but the slave will hang and must be
killed manually.  The location of the difference will be at the end of
filename PIPE_base.out in the master scratch dataT01 directory.

The two runs scripts are identical except for the data directory used and
the number of threads used.  They are almost identical to a standard runs
script, 016.com, except that they use PIPE/016y001.limits as their limits file 
and do not copy their results back to the permanent directory.

If the file PIPE_DEBUG exists in the scratch data directory, it switches 
on single point (at itest,jtest) diagnostic printout to the .log file from 
every call to comparall.  This can be used with or without the named pipe 
comparison.  It is simply using the name-pipe subroutine interface for 
diagnostic printout.  The standard run script includes the following lines 
that can be uncommented to turn on this capability:
#C
#C --- turn on detailed debugging.
#C
#touch PIPE_DEBUG
